# Text Summarization App

This project provides a web-based interface to generate summaries from input text using three state-of-the-art models: BERT, GPT-2, and XLNet. The application leverages Streamlit for the user interface, and users can choose which model to use for summarizing their text.

## Features
- **BERT Summarization:** Extractive summarization model that selects important sentences from the input text.
- **GPT-2 Summarization:** A generative model that generates concise summaries from the input text.
- **XLNet Summarization:** A Transformer model that uses a permutation-based approach for summarization.

## Requirements
The following Python packages are required to run the project:

- `streamlit:` For creating the interactive web app.
- `transformers:` For loading and running the Hugging Face models.
- `bert-extractive-summarizer:` For extractive summarization using BERT.
- `torch:` The underlying library required for the Transformer models.

## Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to get the app running locally:

#### 1. Clone the Repository
```
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-folder>
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) and install the necessary packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install the dependencies, including `streamlit`, `transformers`, `bert-extractive-summarizer`, and `torch`.

#### 3. Run the Streamlit App
After installation, run the app using the following command:
```
streamlit run app.py
```
This will open the app in your default browser at http://localhost:8501.
This will open the app in streamlit app at: https://text-summarization-atick.streamlit.app/

#### 4. Interact with the App
- **Input Text:** Paste or type the text you want to summarize in the text box.
- **Select Model:** Choose one of the summarization models from the dropdown (BERT, GPT-2, or XLNet).
- **Summarize:** Click the "Summarize" button to see the summary generated by the selected model.

## Usage Example
Once the app is running, the interface will allow you to input a text and select a model. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Input Text:** Enter the content you want to summarize (e.g., a paragraph or article).
2. **Choose Model:** Select either BERT, GPT-2, or XLNet as the summarization model.
3. **Click Summarize:** Click on the "Summarize" button to generate and view the summary.
